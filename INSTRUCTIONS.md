# Fin.AI — instruction log

The instruction log for this project (crash-recovery record).
**Newest entry first.** Format + rules: the workspace `AGENTS.md` →
"Instruction log rule". **Completion = pushed to the remote repo**
(`https://github.com/jblagana/finance-app.git`, branch `main`) — a local
commit is not done.

## 2026-09-10 ~13:05 — Quick-sum revert (operators on keyboard) + Home positioning fix
Status: **in progress**
Progress: 90% — ETA ~10 min (gate passed; commit + push left)

### Instruction (verbatim)
> -revert back the quicksum, i never wanted it gone. my problem was that when i type in the phone, i cant do quicksum because the keyboard that appears is numeric so there are no operators. now make the keyboard add operators.
> -see img, positioning is awkward

### Interpretation (agent — user may edit this section)
- Quick-sum is **reverted, not removed**: my v53 cut was based on a
  misreading — the user wants it back. The real problem was the **keyboard**:
  the amount inputs had `inputmode="decimal"` → phone shows a numeric-only
  pad with no operators. Fix: drop the numeric inputmode so the full
  keyboard (with operators) appears and quick-sum expressions can be typed.
  Agent scope: add-sheet amount + owed-entry inputs (the plan amount has no
  quick-sum button — tell me if you want the full keyboard there too) (user's answer: add the full keyboard there too.).
- "See img, positioning is awkward" — user clarified: the greeting block sits
  directly adjacent to the hero card. Fixed: `.greet` bottom padding 0 → 14px
  (the `.card` has no top margin, so the date was touching the card border).
- Restoring v52's evalExpr as-is exposed a precedence bug: v52's expr() added
  factor() (a single signed number), not term(), so 10-2*3 evaluated to 8,
  not 4. Restored with the fix (expr() → term()); all + - * / ( ) now honor
  standard precedence.
- Plan amount (p_amount): per the user's answer above, it gets the full
  keyboard too — and now parses via the same evalExpr, so expressions work
  there (label updated; the plan sheet has no live = hint, only on submit).
- Verified, no changes needed: chat.js (v52 chat.js has no quick-sum text)
  and check_owed.py (no quick-sum test cases — owedBal math only).
- v54 shell bump + gate + push when done.

### Subtasks
- [x] Log the instruction
- [x] Revert quick-sum from v52 (git `b156616`): evalExpr (+precedence fix), addAmtEq + live = hint, owed entry expr — app.js, index.html (chat.js / check_owed.py verified: nothing to revert)
- [x] Full keyboard on the amount inputs (f_amount, oent-amt, p_amount — numeric inputmode / type=number dropped)
- [x] Home positioning fix (.greet 14px bottom padding)
- [x] v54 bump: sw.js, SHELL_RELEASE, check_site.py (quick-sum checks back + keyboard check), READMEs
- [x] Gate: all checks passed (check_site.py + check_owed.py)
- [ ] Commit + push

## 2026-09-10 ~12:45 — Instruction log: verbatim + interpretation + status/percent/ETA
Status: **done** (pushed in this commit; hash = top of `git log`)
Progress: 100% — ETA was "minutes" (only commit + push left)

### Instruction (verbatim)
> about the logging in agents.md, write my instruction verbatiom, add ur own notes for ur own interpretation - i might edit ur interpretation so make it a habit to regularly check the md file. also add the task status, if ongoing, add ur progress and the subtasks that are already done and still to be done, add a percent progress and the estimated time of completion (completion=pushed to remote repo). if u think the progress clutters the agent.md file, just a create a separate log file

### Interpretation (agent — user may edit this section)
- The blockquote above is the user's exact words (typos included);
  everything below it is the agent's read and the user may edit it freely.
- The agent must **re-read this file before acting** on a logged
  instruction (and again mid-task on multi-step work). If the user edited
  the interpretation, the user's version is the new instruction — follow
  it, and note it if it changes the plan.
- Per-entry fields: Status (`not started` / `in progress` / `done` /
  `blocked`); Progress = percent + ETA; Subtasks = `[x]` done / `[ ]`
  still to do. In-progress entries must carry all three.
- Completion = **pushed to the remote repo** (record the commit hash).
- The detailed log lives in this separate file so the project `AGENTS.md`
  stays a short notes file; the workspace rule was updated to match and
  applies to all projects.

### Subtasks
- [x] Update the workspace rule (chat-root `AGENTS.md`) to the new format
- [x] Create `INSTRUCTIONS.md`; migrate the v53 entry with the true verbatim instruction
- [x] Trim `AGENTS.md` to project notes + rule pointer
- [x] Commit + push (this commit)

## 2026-09-10 11:45 — v53 batch (Unsorted, quick-sum cut, grey LED, named greeting, polish)
Status: **done**
Progress: 100% — completed 2026-09-10 ~12:25; commit `6078e54` pushed to origin/main

### Instruction (verbatim)
> 1 - Unsorted -> rename blank category to Unsorted
> 2 - Unsorted -> add filter
> 3 - Quick sum -> cut
> 4 - After adding an expense -> go to the Ledger
> 5 - Owed -> the e.g. Vhal placeholder is gone, put it back
> 6 - Force online coach -> not sure where this switch is
> 7 - Coach -> chat input placeholder -> shorten
> 8 - Your numbers -> the name placeholder should be: your name, cc prepay day
> 9 - Other placeholders in your numbers -> can be removed, except e.g. Jan (for the name)
> 10 - online coach LED -> not ready should be grey, not yellow
> 11 - Good morning, Hooman! -> good, if a name is set, it will be: Good morning, Hooman! (name)
>
> When you finish, do the v53 bump: sw.js, SHELL_RELEASE, the gate's assertion, the README, and the local helper's check_owed.py. After that, run the full gate and push. Also set up a new habit: log the instruction to the project's agents.md before doing anything else, and keep the status and notes updated. That way, even if I crash in the middle of a task, I can always resume. If the project doesn't have an AGENTS.md, create one. Every project folder must have its own AGENTS.md with an instruction log section.

### Interpretation (agent — user may edit this section)
- The items are terse; my read, one by one (edit freely):
  1+2. "Unsorted" = the bucket for expenses with **no category** (was
      "(no category)") in the donut, ledger rows, and the chat's spend
      breakdown; plus a **category filter** on the Ledger with an explicit
      Unsorted option. The real "Other" category is untouched.
  3. Delete the quick-sum expression parser (`evalExpr`) and the "= <sum>"
      hints from the Add sheet and Owed entries; amounts become plain
      numbers (phone keyboards are numeric-only — operators can't be typed).
  4. After "Add expense": close the sheet **and switch to the Ledger**.
  5. Restore the `e.g. Vhal` placeholder on the Owed name input.
  6. The force-online switch is wired in `ai.js` but not visible — make it
      visible/working. (Found: the HTML element never existed → added to
      Settings → Coach (online).)
  7. Shorten the chat input placeholder (→ "Ask the coach…").
  8. "Your numbers" editor labels: `name` → "your name", `prepay day` →
      "cc prepay day".
  9. Remove every other placeholder in that sheet except "e.g. Jan".
  10. Coach LED: not-ready state yellow → **grey**.
  11. Home greeting carries the name. Shipped behavior: no name set →
      "Good morning, Hooman!"; name set → "Good morning, <name>!".
      (Agent interpretation of an ambiguous line — user, edit if wrong.)
- Finish line: v53 shell bump (`sw.js` cache, `SHELL_RELEASE`,
  `check_site.py` assertions, READMEs, `check_owed.py`), full gate, push.
- Side request: establish the instruction-log habit (format refined in the
  newer entry above).

### Subtasks
